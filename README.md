# UW Student Housing Capacity
## Nathan Chan | December 3, 2019
### Data Visualization Project: HTML, CSS, D3.js, Leaflet.js

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to visualize the on-campus housing capacity for the University of Washington, Seattle using D3.js and Leaflet.js to understand student hubs and origin and destination patterns. 

This analysis solely examines on-campus housing on the north and west side of the main University of Washington Seattle Campus. 

## Technology
A combination of D3.js and Leaflet.js were used to conduct a geospatial analysis of the population on the UW campus. D3 and Leaflet were chosen to easily map data to geographic latitudes and longitudes using Open Street Map. 

Sample code was sourced from d3-graph-gallery. 

## Results
The results of the analysis show that two dorms with the highest capacity are on north campus while west campus has some of the dorms with the lowest capacity. 

On the whole, west campus still houses a majority of the students with 55% of the housing capacity split amongst 9 residences. On the other hand, there are 6 residences on north campus. 


## Additional Features
This project is not complete and some features I would like to add include: 
* Showing a distribution by region using a pie chart
* Showing a time series of housing capacity over time for the past 5 years given the recent construction
* Including off campus housing
* Mapping lecture hall capacities to show possible origin-destination pairs
* Including traffic flows to other key destinations
* Mapping UW Bothell and UW Tacoma data
